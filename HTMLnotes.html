      <h1>Starting an HTML document</h1>
      <div>
	<p>You are able to let browsers be aware of the fact that you are using HTML by starting up a Document Type Declaration.
The docuemnt type declaration must always be the first line of code in an HTML docuemnt. Even if its forgotten, the HTML document will still work though it's risky 
After the Document Type Declaration add opening and closing HTML tags.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h2>A Bit of Preparation (Body, Title)</h2>
	<p>You can add titles to your web page using the title element. 
Before we can add content, opening and closing body tags must be on screen.
Once the file has a body, it can have different sort of things, like images, text, and buttons, which can be added to the body. 
"Self-closing elements" hold all the things that an internet browser will need to render an element inside of a single tag.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h2>Some formatting (Break Element, and P Element)</h2>
	<p>The line break element breaks up a line and will push all of the text to the next, so that text can look cleaner, depending on what you're doing.
 When an element is contained inside another element, it is considered the child of that element, and that one would play the role of a parent.
 HTML documents are a collection of parent and child document.
The P element is the child to the Body element and is used to hold what is to be considered as normal text.
Whitespace and indentation are two systems that programmers use to keep track of their of how elements are related, in their documents.
The two of them use the independant position of elements to whitespace and indentation within an HTML file.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h2>Different Attributes and Elements (Part 1)</h2>
	<p>In HTML, comments can also be written, like in Lua, though they're formatted differently.
In HTML, there are heading elements (hi,h2, h3, h4, h5, h6). In total, there are 6 of them and they have various functions such as giving titles to articles and pages.
 is used to hold a piece of normal text.
The div element is used to divide HTML documents into multile sections.
The em and strong exist so that they can describe and organize the content that appears on your pages.
Unordered list tag create a list items in a randomized list with bullet points. 
individual items must be listed using li. 
the ul tag cannot hold raw text so that is why we need the li. 
ol are unordered lists and instead of bullet points, there are numbers.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
      <h2>Different Attributes and Elements (part 2)</h2>  
      <h5>THIS SECTION WILL MAINLY FOCUS ON LINKING IMAGES AND WEBSITES TO YOUR HTML DOCUMENT</h5>
	<p>The img tag allows you to add an image to a web page.
The alt attritbute is solely used with the <img> element. It's value should be describing an image.
It helps with the visually impaired attribute. 
The video tag lets you add videos to the page and is very similar to the img tag.
As a project grows in size, people may want to include extra folders within their main folders.
about.html, contact.html, and index.html are all different types of files. 
 If the files index.html is being displayed, then the other two will know that it's been open since their all in the same folder. 
Nav link is used to wrap links and organize them.</P> 
<h1> Welcome to Tables! </h1>
    <div>
      <p>In most websites, there are tables that are used to display information and this is the case because they are capable of presenting data and info very eficiently. 
Before actually inserting the data, we must naturally create the table first by using the Table element.
Similar to HTML's body element, the table element will contain all of the information.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Getting To Know the Basics!</h2>
      <p>First off, to insert elements, we're going to need tables and rows to do such, and the Table Row element (tr) will do just that.
If you wish to add data, you must use td, or Table Data.
If you would like to addtitles to your rows and columns in your table, use the th element.
The Row Value makes it clear that a title goes with a specific row.
The col value makes it clear that a certain title goes with a specific column.
 Using the colspan attribute, one can spread something across multiple columns. 
 It is possible to make borders on a graph using CSS, which can achieve a very similar effect to the now discontinued Border attribute.
 When the content within tables begins to grow, they will become noticeably long but the tbody element can section off these long tables.
 Note: All of your info must be contained within this element. 
 The rowspan element is one that is used for information that spans mutiple rows in a graph. 
 The thead element is used to section off the headings.
 The tfoot element can be used to section off the bottom of a graph.</p> 
     </div>
     <div>
     <h3>Styling with CSS</h3>
        <p>By nature, tables are typically boring, bland, and an overall disaster, just like contemporary art.
Unlike art though, HTML tables have a way to look good by getting a makeover with CSS.
With CSS, you can change and alter the font size, colour, add borders, and control their sizes too.</p>
